Working on creating an MVC for a video rental service, just the backend for now in node, express, and mongoose/mongo. 

Currently implemented:
-User schema and controllers
-Genre schema and controllers
-Movie schema and controllers
-simple GET, POST, PATCH endpoints for each.
-Authentication using bcrypt 


To be implemented:
-Role-based authorization using JWT
-Rental schema and controllers. Possibly using transactions.
